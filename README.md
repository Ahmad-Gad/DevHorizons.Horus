# DevHorizons.Horus
Horus is a smart rule engine SDK and API to help the orgnizations to build their multi-tenant rules away of the main source code and to avoid hard coding conditions.

The rules can be validated and tested on the SDK before being published to make sure they are designed as they are meant to behave.
